I have the following changes in my git repo that I have undone. there are three commits here that I don't want to remove from my git history. I want to make a new commit that undoes these changes. what do I do?

Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 3 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)PS C:\code\LearningByDoing> git remote show origin

Based on your situation, you want to create a revert commit that undoes the changes from those 3 commits while keeping them in the git history. Here's what you should do:

## Option 1: Revert the range of commits (Recommended)

First, you need to identify the commit hashes of the 3 commits you want to undo. Then use:

```bash
# First, pull to get the latest commits
git pull

# Find the commit hashes of the 3 commits you want to revert
git log --oneline -5

# Revert the range of commits (replace OLDEST_COMMIT and NEWEST_COMMIT with actual hashes)
git revert --no-commit OLDEST_COMMIT^..NEWEST_COMMIT

# Then commit the revert
git commit -m "Revert recent changes from commits OLDEST_COMMIT to NEWEST_COMMIT"
```

## Option 2: If you already have the changes staged

Since you mentioned you've already "undone" the changes and they appear to be staged, you can simply:

```bash
# Commit your current staged changes as a revert
git commit -m "Revert changes from recent 3 commits"

# Then push
git push origin main
```

## Option 3: Revert each commit individually

```bash
# Pull first
git pull

# Revert each commit individually (most recent first)
git revert HEAD
git revert HEAD~1  
git revert HEAD~2

# Push the revert commits
git push origin main
```

## What this accomplishes:

- ✅ Keeps the original 3 commits in history
- ✅ Creates new commit(s) that undo those changes
- ✅ Maintains a clean, traceable git history
- ✅ Safe for shared repositories

The key difference from `git reset` is that `git revert` creates new commits that undo the changes rather than removing the original commits from history.

Which option would you prefer to use?
